<h1> Huffman Encoder: </h1> 
<p>In this project, I implemented an efficient scheme for compressing a text message called Huffman coding.
  A simple method to encode text as a string of 0s and 1s is to represent each character as a unique string of 8 binary digits(bits). 
  A text message is thus translated into a string of bits. By exploiting the fact tht not all characters appear with the same frequency in the text,
  We can encode rarely used characters with long codes and frequently used ones with short codes.</p> 
 
<p>The goal of this project is to build a program that reads a textfile, counts the frequency of each character, creates a binary heap with the frequencies and then uses that heap to create a HuffmanTree. This project is made up of 4 files eaach with multiple classes and methods.</p>
